## **GoogleLib for C** ##
This is try for building google api library for C.
This repository is its very first steps. I need this library
for building a Google Drive application for linux (and most
unixoid systems).

**The initial goals are:**

* Complete RESTApi calls
* Simple error handling for JSON responses (by Google) (gapi)
* Portability for almost any Linux box

**Dependencies**

* OpenSSL library
