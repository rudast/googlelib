Googlelib for c (googlelib-c)
===================
This project intends to help other programmers use [**Google API**](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/).  There was not any library for this written in C. When it is completed by using Googlelib for c you can connect and handle all Google Apis easily, so other applications can be written to integrate features from Google (eg. Google Drive etc.). A basic goal is to be able to compile on most systems and keep low dependencies. So far only *OpenSSL* is used.

**Some initial goals are:**

* Complete Api calls
* Error Handling for Json Response ( returned by GoogleResponse() )
* Portability for almost any Linux box

**Dependencies**

* OpenSSL library
