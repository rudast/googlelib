{"name":"Googlelib-c","tagline":"Github Repository for GoogleLib for C","body":"Googlelib for c (googlelib-c)\r\n===================\r\nThis project intends to help other programmers use [**Google API**](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/) in their programs.  There was not any library for this written in C.  Googlelib-c helps connect and handle all Google Apis easily, so other applications can be written to integrate features from Google (eg. Google Drive etc.). A basic goal is to be able to compile in most systems. \r\n\r\n**Some initial goals are:**\r\n\r\n* Complete Api calls\r\n* Error Handling for Json Response ( returned by GoogleResponse() )\r\n* Portability for almost any Linux box\r\n\r\n**Dependencies**\r\n\r\n* OpenSSL library\r\n\r\n\r\nContribute\r\n----------\r\n\r\nGoogleLib-c is written (and will continue) according with POSIX and C11 standards. Linux Coding style and Comments has been adapted. So if you decide to contribute please use them. \r\n","google":"UA-55896068-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
